# Airline-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
The goal of the project is to gain knowledge of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments based on a data set of 14,640 Tweets directed towards 6 different domestic airlines. From these Tweets, airlines are able to gain valuable insights into how their customers feel about policy, procedures, and experience.
